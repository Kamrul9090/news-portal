                        <h5>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and
                                const.
                                var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in
                                JavaScript.variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                let keyword in JavaScript: The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.The
                                scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the
                                particular block.Users cannot re-declare the variable defined with the let keyword but
                                can update it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                keyword in JavaScript: The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the
                                let keyword, except the user cannot update it.
                            </p>

                        <h5>What is the difference between an arrow and a regular function?</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the
                                arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are
                                heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this
                                inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and
                                is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.
                            </p>

                        <h6>What is the difference between map, forEach, filter, and find?</h6>
                        <p>
                            The main difference between this two methods is that forEach allows you to change elements
                            of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array
                            and intended for making new array based on original one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches
                            and the element that do not match are removed. The only difference is the filter() method
                            search through all the elements while find() method search through all the child elements
                            only
                        </p>

                        <h6>
                            Why use template string?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            You can use template strings to write your string exactly how you want it to appear, without
                            all the quotation marks and confusion. Template strings make it very easy to spot a missing
                            space and make your string more readable.
